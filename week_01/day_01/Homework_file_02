Another homework file - with a question.
When I create a repo it makes a new folder so I ended up with

codeclan_homework_SarahHughes
  codeclan_homework_SarahHughes

is this what im supposed to be doing?

When I look in terminal I can see only the second level folder is labelled as a git: (main)
you can rename folders in terminal with the mv command
